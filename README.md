# random-music-to-walkman

Fill up a device (usb key, mp3 player, directory, etc.) with random music from a source directory.

This is the initial commit and more details will be added as I revise the script, which is fairly old now (and not very well structured).

## To Do List

- Currently the songs are only sorted by artist, not by song name. They should be sorted by both;
- Add test option which creates a fixed size temporary destination (see [this tutorial](http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/quota_tutorial.html)).
